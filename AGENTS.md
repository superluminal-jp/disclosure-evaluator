## Overview

**Purpose**: This document defines the rigorous standards, methodologies, and quality gates that AI coding assistants MUST follow when assisting with software development.

**Scope**: Applies to all code generation, refactoring, testing, documentation, and architectural decision-making activities.

**Philosophy**: Specification-first, test-driven, domain-centric development with zero tolerance for quality degradation.

**Key Principle**: Quality is non-negotiable. Every line of code, every test, every document must meet the highest professional standards.

---

You MUST strictly adhere to the following frameworks and principles when assisting with software development. No deviations are permitted.

## MANDATORY DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### Workflow Overview

**PHASE 1: SPECIFICATION CREATION (Mandatory First Step)**

1. Requirements Gathering
2. Specification Creation
3. Validation Gate
4. Stakeholder Approval

**PHASE 2: IMPLEMENTATION (Test-Driven & Domain-Centric)**

1. Write Failing Tests (Red)
2. Implement (Green)
3. Refactor
4. Verify Specs
5. Document

### PHASE 1: SPECIFICATION CREATION (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)

**AI Agent MUST enforce the following sequence:**

#### 1. Requirements Gathering (AI-assisted)

**Objective**: Understand the full context before writing any code.

**Activities**:

- **Stakeholder identification and analysis**: Who will use this? Who maintains it? Who approves it?
- **Business value proposition definition**: Why are we building this? What problem does it solve?
- **Success criteria establishment**: How do we measure success? What are the KPIs?
- **Risk assessment and mitigation**: What could go wrong? How do we prevent it?

**Example Questions to Ask**:

```
- "Who are the primary users of this feature?"
- "What business problem does this solve?"
- "What are the performance requirements?"
- "Are there security or compliance requirements?"
- "What are the acceptance criteria?"
- "What are the edge cases we need to handle?"
```

#### 2. Formal Specification Creation (AI-guided)

**Objective**: Create comprehensive, testable specifications before implementation.

**Required Artifacts**:

- **IEEE 29148 compliant requirements specification**: Formal requirements document
- **Gherkin scenarios for behavior specification**: Given-When-Then scenarios
- **Domain model definition using DDD patterns**: Entities, value objects, aggregates
- **API contracts using OpenAPI 3.0**: Complete API specifications
- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**: Document significant decisions

**Practical Example**:

```gherkin
Feature: User Authentication
  As a system user
  I want to securely authenticate
  So that I can access protected resources

  Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
    Given the user "john@example.com" exists with password "SecurePass123!"
    And the user account is active
    When the user attempts to login with email "john@example.com" and password "SecurePass123!"
    Then the authentication should succeed
    And a JWT token should be returned
    And the token should expire in 3600 seconds
    And the login event should be logged with correlation ID

  Scenario: Failed login with invalid password
    Given the user "john@example.com" exists
    When the user attempts to login with email "john@example.com" and password "WrongPassword"
    Then the authentication should fail
    And the response should return HTTP 401
    And the error message should be "Invalid credentials"
    And the failed attempt should be logged
    And the account should lock after 5 failed attempts
```

#### 3. Specification Validation (AI-verified)

**Quality Gates**:

- **Completeness check**: ≥95% coverage of all requirements
- **Consistency validation**: No contradictions between specifications
- **Stakeholder review and approval**: All stakeholders have signed off
- **Traceability matrix creation**: Clear mapping from requirements to implementation

**Validation Checklist**:

```yaml
completeness:
  functional_requirements: "≥95% specified"
  non_functional_requirements: "≥90% specified"
  edge_cases: "All identified and documented"
  error_scenarios: "All documented with handling strategy"

consistency:
  no_contradictions: true
  terminology_aligned: true
  domain_language_consistent: true

stakeholder_approval:
  business_owner: "approved"
  technical_lead: "approved"
  qa_lead: "approved"
  operations_lead: "approved"

traceability:
  requirements_to_tests: "100% mapped"
  tests_to_code: "100% mapped"
  code_to_documentation: "100% mapped"
```

**CRITICAL GATEWAY**: **NO CODE SHALL BE WRITTEN UNTIL SPECIFICATIONS ARE COMPLETE AND APPROVED**

### PHASE 2: IMPLEMENTATION (Specification-Driven)

**AI Agent MUST follow specification-driven approach:**

1. **Test-First Implementation** (TDD)

   - Red-Green-Refactor cycle
   - Specification-based test generation
   - Property-based testing implementation

2. **Domain-Driven Implementation** (DDD)

   - Ubiquitous language enforcement
   - Bounded context implementation
   - Clean architecture application

3. **Quality Assurance** (Continuous)
   - Specification compliance verification
   - Code quality gates enforcement
   - Documentation maintenance

## AI AGENT ENFORCEMENT RULES

### MANDATORY AI BEHAVIOR

**When user requests code implementation:**

1. **FIRST RESPONSE**: "I need to create specifications before writing code. Let me start with:"

   - Requirements analysis
   - Stakeholder identification
   - Success criteria definition

2. **SPECIFICATION CREATION**: AI MUST create:

   - Formal requirements document
   - Gherkin scenarios
   - Domain model
   - API contracts
   - Architecture decisions

3. **VALIDATION GATE**: AI MUST verify:

   - Specification completeness (≥95%)
   - Stakeholder coverage
   - Technical feasibility
   - Business value alignment

4. **IMPLEMENTATION APPROVAL**: Only after specification approval:
   - Begin TDD cycle
   - Follow DDD patterns
   - Maintain specification traceability

**REJECTION CRITERIA**: AI MUST reject any code-first requests with:

```
SPECIFICATION GATE VIOLATION DETECTED

I cannot write code without specifications. Please allow me to create
the required specifications first.

What I need to do before writing code:
1. Gather and document requirements
2. Create formal specifications (Gherkin scenarios, domain models, API contracts)
3. Validate specifications for completeness (≥95% coverage)
4. Obtain stakeholder approval
5. Create traceability matrix

Once these are complete, I can proceed with:
- Writing failing tests (Red)
- Implementing features (Green)
- Refactoring code (Refactor)
- Documenting implementation

Would you like me to start with requirements gathering?
```

**Pragmatic Exception Handling**:

For small, well-understood changes (e.g., fixing typos, updating dependencies, simple bug fixes), the AI MAY use abbreviated specifications if:

1. The change is <10 lines of code
2. The behavior is clearly defined and understood
3. The change has no architectural implications
4. Existing tests cover the change area
5. The change is documented in commit message

**Example of Valid Exception**:

```python
# Change: Fix typo in error message
# Spec: Change "Auhtentication failed" to "Authentication failed"
# Impact: Documentation only, no logic change
# Tests: Existing tests still pass
```

    Before implementing, let me gather requirements:
    1. Who are the users? (Internal staff, external customers, both?)
    2. What authentication methods? (Email/password, OAuth, SSO, MFA?)
    3. What are security requirements? (Password policies, session management?)
    4. What are performance requirements? (Expected users, response time?)
    5. What compliance requirements? (GDPR, SOC2, HIPAA?)

step_2_specification:
  ai_creates:
    - requirements_spec: "IEEE 29148 compliant document"
    - gherkin_scenarios: "All authentication flows"
    - domain_model: "User, Session, Credential entities"
    - api_contract: "OpenAPI 3.0 specification"
    - adr: "Why JWT over sessions, why bcrypt for hashing"

step_3_validation:
  checks:
    - completeness: "≥95%"
    - consistency: "No contradictions"
    - security_review: "All vulnerabilities addressed"
    - performance_analysis: "Can handle expected load"

step_4_implementation:
  tdd_cycle:
    - red: "Write failing auth tests"
    - green: "Implement auth logic"
    - refactor: "Clean up, remove duplication"
  documentation:
    - api_docs: "Auto-generated from OpenAPI"
    - user_guide: "How to authenticate"
    - runbook: "How to troubleshoot auth issues"
```

#### Workflow 2: Bug Fix

```yaml
step_1_reproduce:
  - Create failing test that reproduces bug
  - Document expected vs actual behavior
  - Identify root cause

step_2_specify_fix:
  - Document what needs to change
  - Identify affected components
  - Assess risk of regression

step_3_implement:
  - Fix code to make test pass
  - Verify no regressions
  - Update documentation if behavior changed

step_4_verify:
  - All tests pass
  - Quality gates pass
  - Documentation updated
```

#### Workflow 3: Refactoring

```yaml
step_1_establish_baseline:
  - Ensure comprehensive test coverage
  - Document current behavior
  - Identify code smells

step_2_plan_refactoring:
  - Define target architecture
  - Create ADR for significant changes
  - Plan incremental steps

step_3_refactor_incrementally:
  - Make small changes
  - Keep tests green at each step
  - Commit frequently

step_4_verify_improvement:
  - Measure complexity reduction
  - Verify performance unchanged or improved
  - Update documentation
```

### AI Assistant Communication Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Specification Elicitation

```
BAD:
User: "Add a payment feature"
AI: "Here's the code for payment processing..."

GOOD:
User: "Add a payment feature"
AI: "Let me gather requirements for the payment feature:

1. Payment Methods:
   - Which payment methods? (Credit card, PayPal, Stripe, bank transfer?)
   - Multiple payment methods or single?
   - Stored payment methods or one-time?

2. Business Rules:
   - Currency support? (Single or multi-currency?)
   - Refund policy? (Full, partial, time-limited?)
   - Failed payment handling? (Retry logic, notification?)

3. Security & Compliance:
   - PCI DSS compliance needed?
   - Data encryption requirements?
   - Audit trail requirements?

4. Integration:
   - Third-party payment gateway?
   - Webhook handling for async notifications?
   - Reconciliation requirements?

Once we clarify these, I'll create formal specifications."
```

#### Pattern 2: Quality Gate Enforcement

```
BAD:
AI: *Generates code without tests*
AI: *Uses print() for logging*
AI: *Returns None for errors*

GOOD:
AI: "I've completed the implementation. Let me verify quality gates:

- Test Coverage: 87% (line), 82% (branch) - PASS (≥80%, ≥70%)
- Type Coverage: 98% - PASS (≥95%)
- Cyclomatic Complexity: Max 8 - PASS (≤10)
- Structured Logging: JSON format with correlation IDs - PASS
- Error Handling: Result<T, E> pattern used - PASS
- Documentation: All public APIs documented - PASS
- Security: No secrets in code, input validation present - PASS

All quality gates passed. Ready for review."
```

#### Pattern 3: Architecture Decision Documentation

```
BAD:
AI: *Makes architectural choice without explanation*

GOOD:
AI: "I need to make an architectural decision. Creating ADR:

# ADR-001: Use PostgreSQL for Data Persistence

## Status
Proposed

## Context
We need a database for storing user data, transactions, and audit logs.

## Decision
Use PostgreSQL as the primary database.

## Consequences

### Positive:
- ACID compliance for financial transactions
- Mature ecosystem and tooling
- Strong JSON support for flexible schemas
- Excellent performance for complex queries
- Built-in full-text search

### Negative:
- Higher operational complexity than managed NoSQL
- Scaling requires careful planning
- Learning curve for team unfamiliar with SQL

### Alternatives Considered:
- MongoDB: Rejected due to lack of ACID guarantees
- DynamoDB: Rejected due to complex query limitations
- MySQL: Considered, but PostgreSQL has better JSON support

Do you approve this decision?"
```

### Code Quality Examples

    try:

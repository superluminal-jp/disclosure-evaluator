# Feature Specification: Ë§áÊï∞ÊñáÊõ∏„ÅÆ‰∏ÄÊã¨Ë©ï‰æ°

**Feature Branch**: `001-`  
**Created**: 2025-10-04  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Ë§áÊï∞ÊñáÊõ∏„ÅÆ‰∏ÄÊã¨Ë©ï‰æ°: Ë§áÊï∞„ÅÆÊñáÊõ∏„ÇíÂêåÊôÇ„Å´Ë©ï‰æ°„Åó„ÄÅÂäπÁéáÁöÑ„Å™Âá¶ÁêÜ„ÇíÂÆüÁèæ"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As an administrative officer, I want to evaluate multiple documents simultaneously for disclosure compliance, so that I can process large volumes of information efficiently and make consistent disclosure decisions across all documents.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I have multiple documents to evaluate, **When** I select a batch of documents for evaluation, **Then** the system processes all documents simultaneously and provides individual evaluation results for each document
2. **Given** I have a folder containing multiple documents, **When** I specify the folder path for batch evaluation, **Then** the system automatically discovers all documents in the folder and evaluates each one
3. **Given** I have a mix of document types (text files, PDFs, Word documents), **When** I submit them for batch evaluation, **Then** the system extracts text content from each document type and evaluates them consistently
4. **Given** I am running a batch evaluation, **When** one document fails to process, **Then** the system continues processing other documents and reports the failure separately
5. **Given** I have completed a batch evaluation, **When** I review the results, **Then** I can see a summary of all evaluations and individual detailed results for each document

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a document is corrupted or unreadable?
- How does the system handle documents that exceed size limits?
- What occurs when the batch contains documents in unsupported formats?
- How does the system manage memory when processing very large batches?
- What happens when the LLM API rate limits are exceeded during batch processing?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST accept multiple documents as input for batch evaluation
- **FR-002**: System MUST process all documents in a batch simultaneously using parallel processing
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide individual evaluation results for each document in the batch
- **FR-004**: System MUST generate a consolidated summary report for the entire batch
- **FR-005**: System MUST continue processing remaining documents when individual documents fail
- **FR-006**: System MUST support folder-based document discovery for batch evaluation
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle multiple document formats (text, PDF, Word, etc.) in a single batch
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide progress indicators during batch processing
- **FR-009**: System MUST generate batch evaluation results in both JSON and summary formats
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain individual document correlation IDs for traceability
- **FR-011**: System MUST support batch size limits to prevent system overload
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide detailed error reporting for failed documents within a batch
- **FR-013**: System MUST allow users to specify batch processing parameters (concurrency limits, timeout settings)
- **FR-014**: System MUST preserve all individual evaluation metadata for each document
- **FR-015**: System MUST support resuming interrupted batch evaluations

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **BatchEvaluation**: Represents a collection of documents to be evaluated together, contains batch metadata, processing status, and references to individual document evaluations
- **BatchDocument**: Represents a single document within a batch, contains document metadata, processing status, and evaluation results
- **BatchResult**: Represents the consolidated results of a batch evaluation, contains summary statistics, individual results, and processing metadata
- **BatchProgress**: Represents the current state of batch processing, contains progress indicators, completion status, and error information

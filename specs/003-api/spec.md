**Feature Branch**: `003-api`  
**Created**: 2025-10-05  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "API Êèê‰æõ: ‰ªñ„ÅÆ„Ç∑„Çπ„ÉÜ„É†„Åã„Çâ„ÅÆË©ï‰æ°„É™„ÇØ„Ç®„Çπ„ÉàÂèó‰ªò"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As an external system administrator, I want to submit evaluation requests to the disclosure evaluator system via API, so that I can integrate disclosure evaluation capabilities into my existing workflow without manual intervention.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I have an external system that needs to evaluate documents for disclosure compliance, **When** I send a POST request to the evaluation API with document content, **Then** the system processes the evaluation and returns structured results
2. **Given** I have multiple documents to evaluate, **When** I send a batch evaluation request via API, **Then** the system processes all documents and returns individual results for each document
3. **Given** I have submitted an evaluation request, **When** the evaluation is in progress, **Then** I can check the status of my request using a status endpoint
4. **Given** I have submitted a batch evaluation request, **When** I want to retrieve the results, **Then** I can fetch the results using the batch ID provided in the initial response
5. **Given** I have an evaluation request that failed, **When** I check the error details, **Then** I receive clear error messages explaining what went wrong and how to fix it

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the API receives malformed or invalid request data?
- How does the system handle concurrent API requests from multiple external systems?
- What occurs when the evaluation system is overloaded and cannot process requests immediately?
- How does the system manage API rate limiting and request throttling?
- What happens when external systems send requests with unsupported document formats?
- How does the system handle authentication and authorization for external systems?
- What occurs when the LLM services are unavailable during API evaluation requests?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide REST API endpoints for document evaluation requests
- **FR-002**: System MUST accept single document evaluation requests via API
- **FR-003**: System MUST accept batch document evaluation requests via API
- **FR-004**: System MUST return structured JSON responses for all API requests
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide status checking endpoints for ongoing evaluations
- **FR-006**: System MUST return evaluation results via API endpoints
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate all incoming API requests before processing
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle API request errors gracefully with appropriate HTTP status codes
- **FR-009**: System MUST support asynchronous processing for long-running evaluations
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide request correlation IDs for tracking API requests
- **FR-011**: System MUST support API authentication for external systems [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What authentication method should be used - API keys, OAuth, JWT tokens?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST implement rate limiting for API requests [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What rate limits should be applied - requests per minute, concurrent requests, or other limits?]
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide API documentation for external system integration
- **FR-014**: System MUST support different response formats (JSON, XML) based on request headers
- **FR-015**: System MUST handle API versioning to support backward compatibility
- **FR-016**: System MUST provide health check endpoints for external system monitoring
- **FR-017**: System MUST log all API requests and responses for audit purposes
- **FR-018**: System MUST support CORS configuration for web-based external systems
- **FR-019**: System MUST provide error details in API responses for debugging
- **FR-020**: System MUST support request timeout configuration for external systems

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **APIRequest**: Represents an incoming evaluation request from an external system, contains request metadata, authentication information, and document content
- **APIResponse**: Represents the response sent back to external systems, contains evaluation results, status information, and correlation IDs
- **APIStatus**: Represents the current status of an API request, contains processing state, progress information, and error details
- **APIBatch**: Represents a batch evaluation request via API, contains multiple documents and batch processing metadata
- **APIAuthentication**: Represents authentication information for external systems, contains credentials and access permissions
- **APIError**: Represents error information for failed API requests, contains error codes, messages, and resolution guidance
